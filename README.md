# Job-Market-Salary-Dashboard

## Project Objective
I created the Job Market Salary Dashboard to explore and visualize salaries in the Data Science field. This dashboard makes it easy to see how salaries change based on things like experience level, job type, remote work options, role, and country. It’s interactive and designed to be simple and useful for anyone interested in understanding the Data Science job market.
